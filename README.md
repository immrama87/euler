#Project Euler Problem Solutions
![Project Euler Badge](https://projecteuler.net/profile/james.miner.png)

##Usage
To see a particular solution, run `node index` or `npm start`. You will be prompted for a problem number to run (**Do not try to run a problem outside the bounds shown in the prompt** as there is no error handling to make sure a problem exists before trying to load the problem file.)

To run the full test suite, run `npm test`.
